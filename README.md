# NLP-Semantic-Similarity
Project to practice NLP semantic similarity
There are two files in this project. 
The first file named semantic.py is a simple exercise of semantic similarity by comparing two group of things. The first group includes cat, monkey and banana.
The second group includes table, chair and sofa. Two different commands are used to do the comparisions and the results are quite interestings.
The second file named watch_next.py is an exercise of recommending a movie based on similarity analysis. It is a very fun exercise and is widely used
in company like Netflix.
